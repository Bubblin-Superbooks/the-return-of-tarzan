Each hour was marked by its deadly arrow or cruel spear.

Fall upon your cruel masters and kill them! You have guns, why do you not use them? Kill the Arabs, and we will not harm you. We will take you back to our village and feed you, and lead you out of our country in safety and in peace. Lay down the ivory, and fall upon your mastersâ€”we will help you.</p></div> </div>
