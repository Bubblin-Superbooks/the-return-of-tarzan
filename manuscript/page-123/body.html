Tarzan did not disturb him, but the following morning he narrated the happenings of the previous evening, omitting not a single detail.</p><p>"What a fool I have been," he concluded. "De Coude and his wife were both my friends. How have I returned their friendship? Barely did I escape murdering the count. I have cast a stigma on the name of a good woman. It is very probable that I have broken up a happy home."</p></div> </div>
